# 🐟 SeqFish

**SeqFish** is a Python-based, fully independent bioinformatics pipeline designed for processing paired-end sequencing reads, with a specialized focus on fish taxa analysis. Unlike traditional pipelines, SeqFish performs key tasks such as **primer and adapter trimming**, **demultiplexing**, **merging**, **dereplication**, **denoising**, **clustering**, and **taxonomy assignment** *without relying on external tools like Cutadapt or USEARCH/VSEARCH*. Everything is handled natively within Python, making it lightweight, easy to deploy, and highly customizable.

SeqFish also aims to integrate **AI and machine learning techniques** to further enhance error correction, clustering accuracy, and taxonomic classification in the near future.

## 🔑 Key Features

- 🔧 **Self-contained pipeline** – no external trimming or merging tools required.
- 🎯 **Designed for fish-specific datasets** – optimized for aquatic biodiversity research.
- 🧬 **Complete NGS processing** – from raw reads to taxonomic assignment.
- 🤖 **AI/ML integration (planned)** – smarter error correction, denoising, clustering, and taxonomy prediction.
- 📁 **Modular design** – each step is a standalone Python module.
- 🕹️ **Controller script** – run the full pipeline with one command.
- 💡 **Beginner-friendly** – clean code, clear documentation, and open to contributions!

## 🧪 Pipeline Stages and Modules

| Stage               | Module Name           | Description                                                                 |
|--------------------|-----------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| 1. Trimming        | `seqfish_trim.py`     | Removes adapters, primers, and low-quality bases from paired-end reads.    |
| 2. Demultiplexing  | `seqfish_demux.py`    | Sorts sequences into samples based on barcodes/indexes.                    |
| 3. Merging         | `seqfish_merge.py`    | Merges paired-end reads into full-length sequences.                        |
| 4. Dereplication   | `seqfish_derep.py`    | Collapses identical sequences and counts their frequency.                  |
| 5. Denoising       | `seqfish_denoise.py`  | Corrects sequencing errors using native algorithms.                        |
| 6. Clustering      | `seqfish_cluster.py`  | Groups similar sequences (OTUs or ASVs).                                   |
| 7. Taxonomy        | `seqfish_taxonomy.py` | Assigns taxonomic IDs using custom or public fish databases.               |
| 8. Controller      | `seqfish_run.py`      | Runs all modules in sequence using a configuration file.                   |
